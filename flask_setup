#Hello, in this page I'm going to tell you how to run flask application in your computer. 
#Please remind that all of this are from my understanding only, correct me if I'm wrong, Thanks.

#1) open cmd prompt, create a file by type: mkdir file_name
#2) link your cmd prompt to that file: cd file_name
#3) You have add python file in that file: touch pythonfile.py
#4) Now important part is, you gonna need both flask and venv file. To install flask, just type: pip install Flask. Once you finish installing flask, proceed to venv file 
    by type: python -m venv venv. Ok, now, you're all set.
#5) Open python editor and open your pythonfile.py, in that blank page. You can start write a code: 

    from flask import Flask 
    
    app = Flask(__name__)
    
    #API router 
    @app = ("/")
    def hello():
        return"<h1>Hello, world!</h1>" 
        
     if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.Run()
        
#6) Back to cmd prompt, run that python file: python pythonfile.py 
#7) Now go to google.com. Type link: localhost:5000
#8) You'll see Hello, world! appear on your screen.
